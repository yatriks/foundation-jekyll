# Wade in the Water is a grassroots oral history of Black lives in the United States.

The goal of Wade in the Water is to compose an image of the impact of the movement for Black lives has since the unrest in Ferguson in the summer and fall of 2014, from snapshots provided by a range of Black interviewees. When this all began, it seemed to some that it would blow over by the next news cycle. Now, some are comparing it to the Civil Rights Movement of the 50s and 60s.
