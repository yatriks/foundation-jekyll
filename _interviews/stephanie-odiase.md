**Stephanie, do you want to tell me a little about yourself to start?**

I grew up in New Jersey. I was born in New York but my family moved out to Jersey. And I’m first-generation Nigerian-American. My parents are straight from Nigeria. I have four siblings, including myself, I’m the youngest. I went to boarding school in Jersey for high school, then took a year and went to college at Haverford in Pennsylvania, hated it, transferred to Columbia. Had took a year off in between, and took my other three years at Columbia when I returned from my year off. And I bounced around a tiny bit since graduation, but now I am committing myself to psychology research and focusing on developmental and cultural research in low-income and conflict-afflicted countries.

**A lot of the people that I’ve interviewed that are first-generation Americans have talked about their parents viewing African or African-diasporic immigrants as a different subset of Black from Black Americans. Is your family is like that? **

Most definitely. And actually, funny enough, I was in line for the Daily Show with Trevor Noah, and I met some other girls, who, funny enough, were also at Columbia, who also went to boarding school, and we were talking about that. I forget how it came up, but I was like, “yeah, I’m Nigerian, I’m not the poster child for Black culture”--and the girl looked at me sideways. Like she was really offended.

And I’m thinking, I’m not saying that I’m not Black. Obviously I’m Black. Look at me, I’m Black. This is not a question, I’m not Raven Symone. I’m a Black person. But Black culture and Nigerian culture, when you break it down culture-wise, are two very different things. I’m Nigerian first, and I was raised in a very Nigerian household, so I can’t identify with some of the things that my Black friends did or know in their childhoods. Like I wasn’t raised on Biggie and Tupac, I was raised on [inaudible] and Fela, like that’s my childhood that other people don’t get. …So I’m just kind of living with a triple consciousness. Whereas I’m Nigerian, I’m also literally African-American. And I’m also living in a white society. You know, it’s taking it to a whole other level.

**What was your viewpoint on anti-blackness, before all of this other stuff was blowing up?**

I think I’ve always dealt with anti-Blackness on a white people level, like you know—“we’re not about your life.” Implicitly, of course.

And also on a Nigerian level, and people in my culture promoting antiblackness themselves, like, we’re not like other Black people, you can’t be like akata, which is like, it’s not necessarily--I’m from the Edo tribe, but it’s more of a Nigerian, you know, slang dialect term for Black people, which translates to “worthless people.”

**Oh man, that’s rough.**

It’s rough. So yeah, I went off for boarding school--mind you, I graduated top of my elementary school, ground-breaking test scores. I’ve gotten a Fulbright Scholarship. Then I get there, and then it’s like, “Oh, I don’t know if you’re smart enough,” or, “I don’t know if you’re *well-prepared* enough to take this class. I don’t know if you’re *ready* to take this class.” And I would always take the class, and I would do well in it. And then I’m like, “I don’t know if you’re *ready* for *me.*”
One professor told me, in my freshman year, “I’m not impressed by you.” And I’m like, “I’m not here to impress you, I’m here to get an education.” I’m sorry if you don’t like the way a fourteen year-old is shit talking to you right now, but it is what it is.

**When Mike Brown was shot last summer, and then non-indictment of Darren Wilson happened...how did you feel about those incidents when they happened?**

It really bothered me deeply, obviously, because it just seemed like a snowball effect. After Trayvon, things kind of quieted down slightly, and then you have these three waves, one after another after another. And I remember around December of last year, they had that Millions March in New York. I was there, I know you interviewed Olivia [Harris] and Diana [Umana] as well. We all went together. And it was such a great rallying cry for support. But in my head I always wondered, “what is the point of this?” You know, we’re out here, we’re freezing in the cold, we’re walking for hours, for miles, we’re chanting, we’re protesting. And I think that’s useful, very necessary, but how are we gonna roll this up into a bigger plan? How are we gonna trickle up and actually change legislation, how’re we gonna impact policy, how are we gonna change the protocol about how police treat not just Black and of color but *people?* And I still wonder that.

**What do you think of the movement now, then?**

I want to be positive about the movement now. I really do. But I feel like the movement isn’t doing certain things well enough.

Before this interview I did some more reading up...in the Washington Post, for example, they literally said “this is about the Black Lives Matter movement” and centered it on three people: one of the women who started the movement, Eric Garner, Mike Brown. And I’m thinking in my head, “no, no, no, three women started this, before that even happened.”

When you read [the founders’] manifesto and what it’s actually about, they’re saying “all black lives matter.” But we’re only hearing about Black men. Which is an important place to start. Because if we’re really looking at it, Black men are being decimated in a far higher proportion than Black kids, Black women, etc. etc. But it’s more than that. And I feel like they’re not doing a good enough job supporting the Black women who are being killed.

Sandra Bland obviously got a lot of play, but what about Aiyana Jones, Rekia Boyd? Why aren’t they getting the same airtime? And what about trans people? They’re getting *chopped down.* I feel like every week it’s another trans woman in Philly, D.C., getting *killed.* And no one’s really doing anything about it.

I feel like it, yeah I get it, you have to solidify around one topic and branch out. But it’s kind of becoming a little problematic in the sense that these women started this movement for a different reason than where it’s going now. And I feel like we’re very quick to forget that these women started this movement for *all* Black lives…There’s a lot more to the community than cisgender Black men.

**What do you think of the tactics of the movement right now?**
They’re a good way to open up dialogue, they’re a good way to start the conversation--but that’s not the end-all, be-all, Hail Mary. That’s not gonna save the day, it’s not gonna fix anything. If you think about this as a movement--it’s now a movement, not a moment--it’s still in its business startup phase, but soon we have to shift out of that and make bigger moves. People internationally know about the Black Lives Matter movement. We have to do more. And I don’t feel like we can do more until it’s addressed on a national political level. I feel like that’s the next step…

I think it’s gonna come from the Democrats. The Democrats have always been the party of the underdog, of the minority, of the women, of the non-rich-old-white-man. And I think they’re failing us. They’re blatantly and completely failing us.

At the Democratic [presidential] debate, the question came up. And it wasn’t even [from the moderator], it was a kid asking this question about Black Lives Matter...The same way they steamrolled Planned Parenthood, they steamrolled the Black Lives Matter question. And that would’ve been the one moment for either Bernie or Hillary--especially Bernie--to really address it on the head. It was referred to once, peripherally, and that was it. And I was so pissed off by that. You can’t say that you really wanna support these communities, and not talk about it…

**You know that they’re doing a forum, right?**

Yes, I do. I have feelings about that...it’s a consolation prize. The high-powered people of the Black Lives Matter movement went out to the Republican National Convention and Democratic National Convention. And they wanted to have a full debate about it! Which I feel is fair. And [the RNC and DNC] were like, “we support you, here’s a sticker, bye.” And it’s just like, no, these little town hall forums aren’t gonna do shit. Because they’re not held to the same regulations, the same rigor, as the actual nationally aired debates. So whatever these candidates say or don’t say, they’re not held to the same accountability. And that, to me, is a problem. We have an issue of national importance not given national airtime…That just cheapens the value of Black lives to me.
