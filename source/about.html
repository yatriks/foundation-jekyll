      <p><strong>On the goals of the movement</strong></p>
      <p>I actually do think we should probably burn it all down, honestly. But I also think that it extends way past police brutality. I think that police brutality is a side effect, a symptom of a larger racial dynamic that has happened for years in the
        U.S. That is not the problem. The problem is that people in this country don’t actually value the lives of people of color, period. </p>

      <p><strong>On coping mechanisms</strong></p>
      <p>To cope, I make art...For me, coping is taking the time and space to be reflective about how I actually feel during this period of time that we’re in right now. It gives me the opportunity to cry alone if I need to cry, to be expressive the way
        that I need to be expressive in order to get out my frustrations regarding x,y,z; and make something that sheds light on not only my pain, but the pain that is reflected in millions of Black Americans across the country.</p>

      <p><strong>About Maya</strong></p>
      <p>An encouraging, inspiring space for myself so I can leave my house every day with an understanding of who I am, who I am in relationship to my ancestry, who I am in relationship to this political dialogue currently happening, who I am in relationship
        to no one else, just myself. And being okay with my identity so that I can have that voice, and use it to speak out against brutality, to speak out against sexism and homophobia and transphobia...</p>
